# Project-On-3D-car-using-GLUT
Me and  my project partner made this project in  our 5th semester. This project mainly focuses on Computer graphics. This is a project of a 3D car model using glut libraries in OPENGL. Various modes are used to display the 3D model car using various inbuilt and user defined functions.
